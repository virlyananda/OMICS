In this section, we integrated Biopython package with PyMOL to visualize molecules. <br>

**Step 1:** Find a protein in multiple databases.  <br>
**Step 2:** Introducing Bio.PDB <br>
**Step 3:** Extracting more information from a PDB file <br>
**Step 4:** Computing molecular distances on a PDB file <br>
**Step 5:** Performing geometric operations <br>
**Step 6:** Animating with PyMOL <br>
**Step 7:** Parsing the mmCIF with Biopython <br>
